# iuricarras' Nix-Config

A flake-based multi-user, multi-host NixOS configuration, for NixOS and Home-Manager.

WIP - Based on EmergentMind's Nix-Config, this configuration is tailor made for my use case, consisting on two desktop hosts and one server. More hosts are going to be added in the future, mainly for VM testing.
